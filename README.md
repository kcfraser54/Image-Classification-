# Image-Classification
These programs are written for research I conducted at Seattle University. In both programs I use Tensorflow and convolutional neural network to identify plant diseases. I used the PlantVillage dataset found on Kaggle to train each model.  


#PV_Base.ipynb
This program uses a custom convolutional neural network to identify plant disease via images.

#PlantVillage-MobileNet
This program uses transfer learning to build a convolutional neural network to identify plant disease via images.
